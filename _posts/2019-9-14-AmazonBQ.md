## Why Amazon
Why Amazon?
Because I know Amazon is a top internet retailing company wi‍‌‍‌‍‌‌‌‍‍‌‍‍‌‍‍‍‌‍th a strong focus on customer experience. And there are a lot of talented people in amazon creating amazing products to make people’s life easier. They are always showing strong ownership to their projects and they always want to make things perfect. Those spirits do touch my heart. I remember when I just started to lead smart log analyzer project, everything is new to me. And I’m so passionate about creating great services for customers to save their precious time and money. They could have people hired to sit there watching the visuals we provide, and trying to do treat hunting, to see if there are malicious events among them. But we want it to be more convenient. We want our system to take care of all the stuff automatically. It will detect the malicious stuff, evaluate them, report them and provide suggestions and solve them automatically. The customer only needs to do clicks on the website to make simple decisions based on the suggestions system provide and they can focus more on their own things. That is really similar with Quilt. Quilt also does a great job to help customers focus on their codes. It will take care of patching automatically for hosts. That’s really amazing for customer. So, we have similar spirits. That’s one big reason why I want to join Amazon.

Secondly, the growth of amazon is so impressive, it is not only an online retail shop, it also has a wide range of products like Alexa, kindle, fire tablet and TV, And I have been using Alexa for playing music and controlling my TV. Also I have used AWS to set up websites before. There are so many fantastic technologies and products in Amazon. I will never feel boring if I am in amazon. And I’ll be excited about all the amazing things around me everyday. I can learn a lot of new technologies.
