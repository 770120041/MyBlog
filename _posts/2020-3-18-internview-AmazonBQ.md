每个项目具体的流程是什么一定要很清楚，会问得很细，然后才是你干了什么。

New Grad不会问System Design啊，问OO Design。OO Design就不能纸上谈兵了，不仅要多看人家写的，还要自己多找几个热门题目（Parking Lot, Elevator, ATM, Juke Box等）写写代码。

# STAR
S – Situation - background info

T – Task - what your job was in this situation

A – Activity - what you did - this should be the longest part of the answer

R – Result - positive; quantifiable; what you learned; what you would do differently next time

## Why Amazon? same as why this job
The reason why I’m willing to join is because Amazon has a lot of impressive products,
 not only retail shop, but also like kindle, amzon music and AWS.
  Also there are many fantastic technologies and products in Amazon, 
  I think joining amazon will give me a great opportunity to learn
   a variety of things.

My career is young and I believe that Amazon offers an exceptional place
 for me to learn things and be able to make a bigger impact on people live's

## Introduce yourself
- My name is Zhe. I am currently a software engineer at thoughtspot, 
and I am working on the backend team, mostly working on graph db and authentication,
 I am mostly using Java for my current job.
 
I gradualted from univerity of illinois Urbana Champaign in computer engineering and I got my bachelor's degree in zhejiang university in computer science. I am familiar with C++,c,java,python and I was mostly working on backend development.

For my past working experiences, I was working on Citrix Boston last summer as a software engineer intern working on building a Jenkins pipeline and also developing features using C++.



## The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it? (earn trust, customer obsession)
# STAR
Customer issue. Tell them to solve it too early.

# List

What’s your role in this project
What were the challenges and how you made sure that you finished it perfectly

 What did your manager / peer say, how did they like it
 What did you do afterward

 1.        Basics
a)        Tell me about yourself
b)        Why this company
c)        Why this position / this team
d)        Why leave your last position
e)        Walk me through your typical day at work.


2.        Failure

b)        Tell me a time when you made a mistake
c)        Tell me a time when you received a negative feedback
d)        Tell me a time when you showed resilience
e)        Tell me a time when you didn't meet the expectation
f)        Tell me a time when you took a risk / without approval then you failed
g)        Tell me a goal you didn't achieve

So let me talk about a recent customer issue I was working on at thougthSpot. So when I was on call and I received a customer issue from SRE, and the SRE said that customers are chasing them and this issue is very important. Since I was working on that issue before , so I thought it would be easy so I told customer I will be able to solve it in 2 weeks. But later it ended up taking 3 weeks and the customer and unhappy. 

Looking back, I realized that I should be more conservative for my estimation to customers since they would very upset if you promise something that you can't deliver.

So I learned to managing the expectections of customers. And it would be much better if we told them we need 1 month to deliver this but actually it takes only 2 weeks. 

Another thing I would think about is to make plans for every details so we can have a much more accurate estimation for our projects



3.        Success
a)        Tell me a time when you succeed / a project you proud of
b)        Tell me a time when you exceed the expectation
c)        Tell me a time when you took a risk / without approval then succeed
d)        Tell me a goal you achieved

So let me talk about the project I was working on at Citrix. So the goal of this project is to build a CI pipeline for the team, and all they have is a bunch of tests scripts and testing environments.

[
So the first thing I was to choose between different CI tools. Like gitlab, teamcity and Jenkins.
So teamcity it like more expensive and complicated. Since I am in a kinda small sub team, have only 10 team members and we are building a pipeline only being used inside the team. So my manager told me that the pipeline should be simple so everyone can understand and maintain it. So finally I chose jenkins.
]

So the project requirement was to set it up in 12 weeks, for my whole intern project. But I was able to set it up in 8 weeks. So I had some time to develop some features with other members and my manager is very happy with this.


Why did you choose jenkins?
I have used Gitlab CI before. But one thing that gitlab CI lacks is the plugins, so the team I was workign on is using perforce to keep some binary files, and also they want to use some plugins to support showing the CI in a TV screen.

The other reason is that when I searched only most people said that jenkins is the best CI tool now. So I think I should try using jenkins. So finally I choose Jenkins.

Why can you do that fast?
The first reason is because I had some experiences using Gitlab CI. So I am kinda familiar with the procudure of settting up a ci pipeline.

But I think the most important reason is that I can sync up with other team members all the time. So each time I have some questions or issues, I can unblock my self quickly. So the way I am doing this is to set up a google DOC and share that to all team members. So whenever I have some questions or some ideas, I will post to there. And whenever anyone have time they can answer my questions or give me some suggestions. 

Throught this way, all the team members can Sync up quickly and since this google doc is more like a diary, so even if a new hire joins the team, they can still understand the design and implementations of this pipeline by reading this cdocument.


What did you learn from it?
The most important thing is to communicate with others often. Because everyone is expertise in some areas so asking them can give me the besting understanding of the issues I am facing and they may also encountered same questions before some it would be much more effective for them to give me the answer instead of working that out on my own.


#### What you would do differently?
The think I think I would do differently is to using a Powershell scirpt or Python scirpt rather than Jenkinsfile to call the build scirpt, the reason is that for jenkins, the Jenkinsfile is triggered and executed by the Jenkins Server, not the actually slave that building the product, so it is very tricky to query the environments of the building slaves. The reason why I would prefer not using Jenkinsfile is because the requirement was to build different versions of the product according to the .Net version and Visual Studio version, so they can use same code to build different versions. So I need to qeury the environment variables to decided to target version.


4.        Conflict
a)        Tell me a time when you resolved a conflict on your team
b)        Tell me a time when you disagreed with your manager
c)        Tell me a time when you disagreed with your team / peer
d)        Tell me a time when you provided suggestion but had not been considered, what was the impact of it
e)        Tell me a time when you had to go behind your manager's back to do something

Citrix intern, developing a feature,

Using two different algorithm

So when facing a conflct, the first thing I would like to do is to talk to my coworkers and understand their opions and how they think about the current issues. I think another very import point is not to be emotional and think things logically, don't take things personally.

 Since everyone is working for the interst of the company, so after understanding each other's opion, we will be able to make a calm decision and it is usually a best decision.


5.        Pressure / Challenge
a)        Tell me a time when you handle difficult customer / task
b)        Tell me a time when you were forced to do something you are not familiar with
c)        Tell me a time when you worked under pressure / managed numerous responsibilities / had to multitask
d)        Tell me a time when you overcame an obstacle and delivered the result
e)        Tell me a time when you overcame a challenge
f)        Tell me a time when you worked under close supervision or extremely loose supervision

When I was on call at thouguhtSpot. Customer reported a very important bug that impacting the SingleSign-On system. And many big customers are impacted by this bug and they are't able to login once in a while. So since I was on-call so after discussing with my manager. He suggests I tried to fix this bug myself and try to ask others wheneven I am blocked.

After looking at logs and stack traces. I leart that this bug is hard because it needs to refactor some logic and also it is appeared in many different versions.

[Working on this is a big challenge and under a lot of pressure. because this bug is impacting many customers so there are 3 SRES will send me a message every day asking the updates.]
 But after 2 weeks of hard work, I was able to solve this with the help of other team members. And looking back I am very grateful to my manager to give me the chance to solve a big problem on my own and it also give me a chance to learn the codebase in a hard way.

g)        Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a poor performer on your team.
h)        Tell me about a time when you had to convince your team on some design decision.
Hackathon. Python script.

Spend some time for tooling is definitely helpful because the more automate the process .the better result we can achieve. It was actually a webpage built by one of a start up company, and we found that the sumbition and the received part is actually a json file. But like the most difficult part is actually the authentication of the website.

Course project(毕设)

which language to use

professor told me to use C++ since he has a student has been working on that.

But finally we found we need more algorithms and it is costly to implemetn them in C++ and we finally switched to usinge Python.

Jenkins pipeline google doc rather than a document 


10.        Deadline / Efficiency
a)        Tell me a time when you missed a deadline

Hackathon project in my company.

The upgrader is a py script.
I working on moving the upgrader into the logic of our middleware
Also working with front end team to make sure the user operations are queued.

I was mostly focusing on the  user operations are queued. But as the deadline is approaching. I realized I won't have enough time to move the logic of the py scirp to the middleware(which is written by java). So I modified the upgrader so if it finishes it will write a dummy file and I create a logic to trigger the script and waiting for that script to finish by checking the dummy file. And finnally our team was able to finish all the requirements and I was able to actually move the logic into java file after the hackthon. 


I think this expericene teach me to be careful about deadline, and try my best to use some methods to develiver the result.


b)        Tell me a time when you had to deal with a tight deadline but deliver in time
c)        Tell me a time when you provided a simple solution to a complex problem
d)        Tell me a time you had to be very strategic in multitasks and meet all your top priorities.
e)        Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?

11.        Frugality
a)        Tell me about a time where you thought of a new way to save money for the company.
b)        Describe a time when you had to manage a budget (or manage time/money/resources/etc.). Were you able to get more out of less?
c)        Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time and resources / no resource.

## Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time or resources.
So when once I attended the hackerthon in my school, the projecf of my team was to develop a algorithm for a 
self driving car. So the rule is who can move faster than others while staying on the road can wins, and there are more 30 teams in the competition. The duration of this hackerton is 48 hours, but the problem is that if we want to test the result, it takes around 10 minutes for training and there are many variables in this contest, like the angle of each turn, and speed of the car. So actually the time is really limited for developing a good algorithm.

So the idea I have is that I wrote a python script to sumbit for testing with different parameters and try to compare the result of the submittion.

. And I have figured out all the possible combinations of the parameters and I write a script to submit the parameters for testing all the time. So I can save the time for mannual submitting and waiting and be focusing on the best parameters. Also, I can submit the test even when I go sleep so I can make the best use of the time. And finally with such method, I found the optimum parameters and finally ranked 1st in this competition. 


## 3. Your strength
I think my strenth is that I am always trying to simplify things and learning new things. So for example like when I was using bash, the first thing I would think about is not only memorizing most commands. but also how to typein less words and do the same thing. So I gradually have a script for my bash so like git push, gradle build taskName is simplfied into just one words.

Also I am enjoying makeing plans and stick to it. Citrix intern only 8 weeks.


## 4. Your Weakness
In the past, Procrastination was a huge challenge for me. I’d get jobs done in the last moment. Later, I realized this was hindering my progress when I am working. So I decided to trying to plan ahead and pushing myself to finishing the job before deadline. After I sticking to my plans and finishing all the jobs in advance, I would say that I am starting to enjoy finishing things earlier. 

Most recently, When I was working at Citrix as a summer intern, I was able to finish the project in only 8 weeks, much faster than every one expected before I plan everything in advance and try my best to finish it quickly. And my manager and mentor even said they were so surpised that I finished it so quickly that they can't believe that I havn't learned jenkins CI pipelines before.
