每个项目具体的流程是什么一定要很清楚，会问得很细，然后才是你干了什么。

New Grad不会问System Design啊，问OO Design。OO Design就不能纸上谈兵了，不仅要多看人家写的，还要自己多找几个热门题目（Parking Lot, Elevator, ATM, Juke Box等）写写代码。

# STAR

## The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it? (earn trust, customer obsession)



Case 1: The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I led the smartloganalyzer project for the first time. The original schedule is week, but I suddenly received a message from my manager says that he will show a smartloganalyzer demo to one customer after two days. And at that time I was working on building the alerting system, that will be an important part of the demo. But I paid too much attention on details, I want to make everything perfect. I didn’t notice that I don’t have enough time to finish all the details. Last day before the demo day, my manager pointed that out. I apologized to him and then we started to figure out if there is a way to keep the demo the same as what we want it to be, but sacrificing some backend performance that customer won’t notice, cause it is just a demo. After the demo, I can rewrite the code to meet my requirements. Fortunately, the demonstration was not affected in the end. But from this mistake, I learnt that details are definitely important, but I also need to pay attention to the whole schedule, I need to always keep good communication with my teammates when I have my plan. I need to make sure that my schedule won’t affect other’s schedule.
