每个项目具体的流程是什么一定要很清楚，会问得很细，然后才是你干了什么。

New Grad不会问System Design啊，问OO Design。OO Design就不能纸上谈兵了，不仅要多看人家写的，还要自己多找几个热门题目（Parking Lot, Elevator, ATM, Juke Box等）写写代码。

S – Situation - background info

T – Task - what your job was in this situation

A – Activity - what you did - this should be the longest part of the answer

R – Result - positive; quantifiable; what you learned; what you would do differently next time

## Why Amazon? same as why this job
The reason why I’m willing to join is because Amazon has a lot of impressive products,
 not only retail shop, but also like kindle, amzon music and AWS.
  Also there are many fantastic technologies and products in Amazon, 
  I think joining amazon will give me a great opportunity to learn
   a variety of things.

My career is young and I believe that Amazon offers an exceptional place
 for me to learn things and be able to make a bigger impact on people live's

## The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it? (earn trust, customer obsession)
# STAR
Situation: “A customer rang up complaining that they’d waited more than two weeks for a reply from our sales team regarding a product query.”

Task: “I needed to address the client’s immediate query and find out what went wrong in the normal process.”

Activity: “I apologised, got the details and passed them to our head salesperson, who contacted the client within the hour. I investigated why the query hadn’t been answered. I discovered that it was a combination of a wrong mobile number and a generic email address that wasn’t being checked. I let the client know and we offered a goodwill discount on her next order.”

Result: “The client not only continued to order from us but posted a positive customer service tweet.”

# List

What’s your role in this project
What were the challenges and how you made sure that you finished it perfectly

 What did your manager / peer say, how did they like it
 What did you do afterward

 1.        Basics
a)        Tell me about yourself
b)        Why this company
c)        Why this position / this team
d)        Why leave your last position
e)        Walk me through your typical day at work.


2.        Failure
a)        Tell me a time when you failed on something
b)        Tell me a time when you made a mistake
c)        Tell me a time when you received a negative feedback
d)        Tell me a time when you showed resilience
e)        Tell me a time when you didn't meet the expectation
f)        Tell me a time when you took a risk / without approval then you failed
g)        Tell me a goal you didn't achieve

So let me talk about a recent customer issue I was working on at thougthSpot. So when I was on call and I received a customer issue from SRE, and the SRE said that customers are chasing them and this issue is very important. Since I was working on that issue before , so I thought it would be easy so I told customer I will be able to solve it in 2 weeks. But later it ended up taking 3 weeks and the customer and unhappy. 

Looking back, I realized that I should be more conservative for my estimation to customers since they would very upset if you promise something that you can't deliver.

So I learned to managing the expectections of customers. And it would be much better if we told them we need 1 month to deliver this but actually it takes only 2 weeks. 

Another thing I would think about is to make plans for every details so we can have a much more accurate estimation for our projects



3.        Success
a)        Tell me a time when you succeed / a project you proud of
b)        Tell me a time when you exceed the expectation
c)        Tell me a time when you took a risk / without approval then succeed
d)        Tell me a goal you achieved

So let me talk about the project I was working on at Citrix. So the goal of this project is to build a CI pipeline for the team, and all they have is a bunch of tests scripts and testing environments.

[
So the first thing I was to choose between different CI tools. Like gitlab, teamcity and Jenkins.
So teamcity it like more expensive and complicated. Since I am in a kinda small sub team, have only 10 team members and we are building a pipeline only being used inside the team. So my manager told me that the pipeline should be simple so everyone can understand and maintain it. So finally I chose jenkins.
]

So the project requirement was to set it up in 12 weeks, for my whole intern project. But I was able to set it up in 8 weeks. So I had some time to develop some features with other members and my manager is very happy with this.


Why did you choose jenkins?
I have used Gitlab CI before. But one thing that gitlab CI lacks is the plugins, so the team I was workign on is using perforce to keep some binary files, and also they want to use some plugins to support showing the CI in a TV screen.

The other reason is that when I searched only most people said that jenkins is the best CI tool now. So I think I should try using jenkins. So finally I choose Jenkins.

Why can you do that fast?
The first reason is because I had some experiences using Gitlab CI. So I am kinda familiar with the procudure of settting up a ci pipeline.

But I think the most important reason is that I can sync up with other team members all the time. So each time I have some questions or issues, I can unblock my self quickly. So the way I am doing this is to set up a google DOC and share that to all team members. So whenever I have some questions or some ideas, I will post to there. And whenever anyone have time they can answer my questions or give me some suggestions. 

Throught this way, all the team members can Sync up quickly and since this google doc is more like a diary, so even if a new hire joins the team, they can still understand the design and implementations of this pipeline by reading this cdocument.


What did you learn from it?
The most important thing is to communicate with others often. Because everyone is expertise in some areas so asking them can give me the besting understanding of the issues I am facing and they may also encountered same questions before some it would be much more effective for them to give me the answer instead of working that out on my own.


4.        Conflict
a)        Tell me a time when you resolved a conflict on your team
b)        Tell me a time when you disagreed with your manager
c)        Tell me a time when you disagreed with your team / peer
d)        Tell me a time when you provided suggestion but had not been considered, what was the impact of it
e)        Tell me a time when you had to go behind your manager's back to do something

Citrix intern, developing a feature,

1.research lab example.




So when facing a conflct, the first thing I would like to do is to talk to my coworkers and understand their opions and how they think about the current issues. I think another very import point is not to be emotional and think things logically, don't take things personally.

 Since everyone is working for the interst of the company, so after understanding each other's opion, we will be able to make a calm decision and it is usually a best decision.

## 3. Your strength
I think my strenth is that I am always trying to simplify things and learning new things. So for example like when I was using bash, the first thing I would think about is not only memorizing most commands. but also how to typein less words and do the same thing. So I gradually have a script for my bash so like git push, gradle build taskName is simplfied into just one words.

Also I am enjoying makeing plans and stick to it. Citrix intern only 8 weeks.


## 4. Your Weakness
In the past, Procrastination was a huge challenge for me. I’d get jobs done in the last moment. Later, I realized this was hindering my progress when I am working. So I decided to trying to plan ahead and pushing myself to finishing the job before deadline. After I sticking to my plans and finishing all the jobs in advance, I would say that I am starting to enjoy finishing things earlier. 

Most recently, When I was working at Citrix as a summer intern, I was able to finish the project in only 8 weeks, much faster than every one expected before I plan everything in advance and try my best to finish it quickly. And my manager and mentor even said they were so surpised that I finished it so quickly that they can't believe that I havn't learned CI pipelines before.
