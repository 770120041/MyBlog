# Common Methods
* Collection.empty() - Returns whether the set is empty.
* Collection.size() - Returns the number of elements in the set.
* Collection.begin() – Returns an iterator to the first element in the set.
* Collection.end() – Returns an iterator to the theoretical element that follows last element in the set.

## SET
[docs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-in-cpp-stl/)
#### Insert
insert(const g) – Adds a new element ‘g’ to the set.
```
iterator set_name.insert(element)
iterator set_name.insert(iterator position, element)
iterator set_name.insert(iterator position1, iterator position2) 
```
#### Erase
1. setname.erase(position)
2. setname.erase(startingposition, endingposition)

#### Find
find(const g) – Returns an iterator to the element ‘g’ in the set if found, else returns the iterator to end.

#### Count
set_name.count(element) 
Parameters: The function accepts one mandatory parameter element which specifies the element whose count is to be returned.

Return Value: The function returns 1 or 0 as the set contains unique elements only. It returns 1 if the value is present in the set container. It returns 0 if it is not present in the container.

## Map
Red-Black Tree for keys. So insert and delete are all O(logN)

#### Insert
pair insert(keyvalue, mapvalue) – Adds a new element to the map
#### Erase
erase(const g)– Removes the key value ‘g’ from the map

erase(iterator position) – Removes the element at the position pointed by the iterator

## Unordered Map
When it comes to efficiency, there is a huge difference between maps and unordered maps.
We must know the internal working of both to decide which one is to be used.

| | map  | unordered_map |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Ordering        | increasing  order(by default)   | no ordering |
| Implementation  | Self balancing BST like Red-Black Tree  | Hash Table |
| search time     | log(n)              | O(1) -> Average  O(n) -> Worst Case |
| Insertion time  | log(n) + Rebalance  | Same as search |                 
| Deletion time   | log(n) + Rebalance  | Same as search |


## Pair
This class couples together a pair of values, which may be of different types
A pair is a specific case of a std::tuple with two elements

Accessing with  **p.first** and **p.second**
