# Intro
A query is an expression that retrieves data from a data source. Queries are usually expressed in a specialized query language. Different languages have been developed over time for the various types of data sources, for example SQL for relational databases and XQuery for XML.<br>

C# uses LINQ simplifies this situation by offering a consistent model for working with data across various kinds of data sources and formats. In a LINQ query, you are always working with objects. <br>
Which is similiar to Django's Model, using objects to deal with data retrieving.<br>

exampels
```
class IntroToLINQ
{        
    static void Main()
    {
        // The Three Parts of a LINQ Query:
        // 1. Data source.
        int[] numbers = new int[7] { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };

        // 2. Query creation.
        // numQuery is an IEnumerable<int>
        var numQuery =
            from num in numbers
            where (num % 2) == 0
            select num;

        // 3. Query execution.
        foreach (int num in numQuery)
        {
            Console.Write("{0,1} ", num);
        }
    }
}
