## cd

    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cd
)


### Each drive have seperate current directory
Frequently used :
1.  change to root dir `cd\`
2.  change driver `d:`
3.  use `cd /d` to change current directory and dirve at the same time.

## mkdir&md
create a directory or subdirectory

Syntax `md [<Drive>:]<Path>`

## rd & rmdir
remove a dir

Syntax `rd [<Drive>:]<Path> [/s [/q]]`

`/s` delete all subdir and files, like `rm -r`

`/q` quite mode, don't pompt confirmation for deleting directory tree, only works if `/s` specified 




## 1 & 2
The digit before a redirection symbol is the stream number to redirect.<br>
The default stream is 1, when no number is present, so 1>... and >... are equivalent.<br>

stream 1 is the standard input/output stream, 2 is the standard error stream.

A command can output to multiple streams and it's allowed to redirect each of them to a different destination.

So `2>nul` and `1>nul` simply said that the error output and the normal output will be redirected to nul. So nothing will be outputted.
