## 1371. Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-longest-substring-containing-vowels-in-even-counts/discuss/534135/C%2B%2BJava-with-picture
```py
class Solution:
    def findTheLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        # from left to right, record index of the vowels
        d = { 0 : -1}
        vowels = "aeiou"
        res = 0
        state = 0
        for i,c in enumerate(s):
            j = vowels.find(c)
            if j >= 0:
                state ^= 1 << j 
            if state not in d:
                d[state] = i
            res = max(res, i-d[state])
        return res
```

## 525. Contiguous Array
Using hash map to record the state, if we meet the same state again, means we can find it. The length is `i-(d[counter]+1)+1 = i - d[counter]`
```py
class Solution:
    def findMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        d = {0:-1}
        counter = 0
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == 0:
                counter += 1
            elif nums[i] == 1:
                counter -= 1
            if counter not in d:
                d[counter] = i
            # print(counter,d)
            res = max(res,i-d[counter])
        return res
```
